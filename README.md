# aws
using basic Amazon web services 


LearningJSP :::::
Its an entire jsp photo uploading project.  I have used amazon S3 storage to store the image. I have used amazon RDS database to store the description of that photo. You can put the rar file in the tomcat of your Amazon Ec2 instances and access the application from the public dns of your Ec2 instances.
[NB:  you gonna need a temporary receivedPhoto folder in your C:\\ of EC2. The uploaded photo first need to be stored in receivedPhoto, then it will be uploaded to your S3 bucket.]
